# UserApp AngularJS Example

Example of how to use the [UserApp AngularJS module](https://github.com/userapp-io/userapp-angular/) to add authentication to an AngularJS app.

## Getting Started

* Get your UserApp [App Id](https://help.userapp.io/customer/portal/articles/1322336-how-do-i-find-my-app-id-) and replace 'YOUR-USERAPP-APP-ID' in `js/app.js` with that id.

* Configure your web server to the example path and browse to it with your web browser.

* Try to sign up, log in, reset your password, etc.

**Note:** If you want to test the verification emails and reset password functionality you need to enable those emails in the Email Add-on. 
You find more info about that in the [AngularJS module docs](https://github.com/userapp-io/userapp-angular/).
